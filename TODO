Possible ideas for new features, either via chat commands or periodic updates:

* spec the command objects
* move everything out of the lita namespace
* the "schedule commands" list should include descriptions of each report
* improve format of admin activity messages
* split admin list in to super admins and delegated admins
* more specs
* add a license
* rename to lita-gsuite?
